project models

## user model

this model is for signup of user

```bash
email
username
registration no.
room no.
group
branch
```

## communitites and posts

```bash
class group
mentor
group followed by user(web,python)


We also need a system to check if a person is actually a mentor, that can be done by either using his id and verify it, or 
we can check his name and branch using the MNNIT brachwise list availble at College Website.
